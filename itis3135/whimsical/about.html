    <h2>About Resilient Sloth Naps</h2>
    <p>This whimsical business was founded on one very slothful principle: sometimes, the strongest thing you can do is take a nap. We're a one-product company with a mission to bring joy, rest, and cheeky resilience to people everywhere.</p>

    <p>Inspired by the world’s most chill animal, we designed our nap mat for burned-out students, stressed creatives, and anyone ready to stop, drop, and snooze. Resilient Sloth Naps is more than a nap mat—it’s a reminder that rest is resistance (and cozy).</p>
